## Assembly VisUAL Practice

I collected some of the Assembly codes I wrote during the Spring 2022 semester written in the highly visual ARM emulator - [VisUAL](https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/).


* [Find element with Binary Search](Binary_Search.asm)
* [Calculate Factorial](factorial.asm)
* [Check if a number is a Fibonacci sequence](is_fib_sequence.asm)
* [Find minimum value of an array](array_min.asm)
* [Multiply two numbers](multiply.asm)
* [Example of Addition and Subtraction](add_and_subtract.asm)
